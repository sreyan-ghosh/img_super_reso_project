# img_super_reso_project

contains .ipynb file highlighting how to create a super resolution generator for images using autoencoders. This model has not been trained by me. 
I have used pretrained weights to train the model architecture. There is a scope for improvement in this project. Compute capabilities hinder me from training the
model myself and bettering the results. Dataset used is ImageNet car data but due to immense size of dataset, it has not been included.
